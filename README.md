This project give full fledged operations on connecting Mongo DB, Django (Rest Framework), Angular POST and GET requests.<br />

I have connected Django with MongoDB with the help of Djongo.<br />

Everything is run on the local machine.<br />

To start Angular put ```ng serve``` on the respective path.<br />

To start Django put ```python manage.py runserver```<br />

Make sure to install Djongo and angular materials in the path.<br />

Create a Mongo DB database named 'Mongodbbase' in you local machine.<br />

Run them all and you can use my project.<br />
